# Team Entry File Specification

The Team Entry file, created as a file called T.TMP, is a temporary file created by the game to consolidate all Player Team information into one file. 
All of the data structures which define the Team are compiled into the file. The last 7 data structures including the Species Data structure is copied 1-1 to the Contest File generated by the Pyrosaurus server.
This process is kicked off from the "Call" button on the Modem screen and made possible by configuration stored in the User File where Send Status Indicator is "Send" and the "Call" button is displayed.

## Anti-cheat features
The process of generating this file is to invoke anti-cheat features.
A Level checksum is included to validate that the player's local current level data matches that of the server. 
Additionally, Dino Species scores are re-calculated ensuring file mods have not been done outside of the game.
